# Employ a ring design with inner radius of 100 mm, outer radius of 200 mm (the warm bore of the PS)

# Test 1: Maximum thickness should be 65 mm: the length of Be required to cool pi- from 150 MeV to 100 MeV
# Test 2: Maximum thickness should be 50 mm: the length of Be required to cool pi- from 140 MeV to 100 MeV
# Test 3: Maximum thickness should be 30 mm: the length of Be required to cool pi- from 125 MeV to 100 MeV

# Centred on Z=1915 mm
